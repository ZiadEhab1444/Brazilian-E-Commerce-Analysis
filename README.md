## üéØ Overview

This project presents a comprehensive business intelligence analysis of the Olist e-commerce dataset, covering **100,000+ orders** placed between 2016-2018. Through advanced data analysis and interactive visualizations in Tableau, the project diagnoses critical operational challenges and provides actionable strategic recommendations.

The analysis reveals a company with strong customer acquisition but **critical retention problems**, where 97% of customers never make a second purchase. This project identifies the root causes and provides a roadmap for transformation.

## ‚ùì Key Business Questions Addressed

This analysis addresses five critical strategic questions:

1.  **Why is customer retention critically low?** (3% repeat rate vs 20-30% industry standard)
2.  **What is the primary driver of the 81% customer churn rate?**
3.  **Where are the operational bottlenecks preventing scalable growth?**
4.  **How can the business mitigate its geographic concentration risk?** (42% of revenue comes from a single state)
5.  **What caused the unexplained 40% revenue drop in mid-2018?**

## üî¥ Key Findings

### 1. Customer Retention Crisis ‚ö†Ô∏è
* **The Challenge:** Only a **3% repeat purchase rate** and an **81% churn rate**. The business model is unsustainably reliant on constant (and expensive) new customer acquisition.
* **The Impact:** An estimated **$2.6M is spent annually** just on replacing churned customers, leaving no budget for actual growth.

### 2. The Delivery-Review-Churn Connection üîó
* **The Discovery:** A strong negative correlation was proven: **Long Delivery Times ‚Üí Poor Customer Reviews ‚Üí No Repeat Purchases.**
* **The Evidence:** The data shows that every additional 10 days in delivery time results in a -0.3 drop in average review scores. This is the "smoking gun" explaining the high churn rate.

### 3. Sales Performance Red Flags üö®
* **Order Volume Collapse:** A dangerous **-24.8% month-over-month decline in order volume** was discovered, masked by a temporary and unsustainable rise in average order value.
* **Cross-Sell Weakness:** With an average of only **1.1 items per order** (vs. an industry average of 2.5), the business is missing a **$5-7M annual revenue opportunity**.

### 4. Operational Bottlenecks üöß
* **Carrier Network Problem:** The primary logistics bottleneck is not the sellers (who are efficient), but the **shipping carrier network**, which accounts for an average of 9 days in transit.
* **Geographic Inequality:** A 3-4x difference in delivery speed between regions (5-8 days in S√£o Paulo vs. 20-30 days in the North) makes geographic expansion impossible with the current infrastructure.
